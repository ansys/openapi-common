# Contributing

Code contributions are welcome. The objective of the documentation
for the Open API-Common libary is to facilitate an understanding
of the PyAnsys ``openapi-common`` repository.

It is important to note that this Python package is maintained
by Ansys and any submission is reviewed thoroughly before merging.
However, we still seek to foster a community that can support
user questions and develop new features to make this package
useful for all users.  Thus, both questions and submissions
to this repository are welcomed and encouraged.

For more information about contributting to this project and the build
and testing process, see the "Contribute" topic in the documentation.
For information about PyAnsys development guidelines and the PyAnsys project
as a whole, see the [PyAnsys Developer's Guide](https://github.com/pyansys/about).
