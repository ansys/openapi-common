# Contributing

We absolutely welcome any code contributions, and we hope that this
guide will facilitate an understanding of the openapi-client-common code
repository.

It is important to note that while the openapi-client-common
software package is maintained by ANSYS and any submissions will be
reviewed thoroughly before merging, we still seek to foster a community
that can support user questions and develop new features to make this
software a useful tool for all users.  As such, we welcome and encourage
any questions or submissions to this repository.

For more information about contributions to this project and the build
and testing process check the contributor guide in the documentation.
For more information about PyAnsys development guidelines and the project
as a whole check the [PyAnsys Developer's Guide](https://github.com/pyansys/about).
